               A computer’s motherboard is typically the largest 
                        printed circuit board in a machine’s chassis. It 
                        distributes electricity and facilitates communication 
                        between and to the central processing unit (CPU), random 
                        access memory (RAM), and any other component of the 
                        computer’s hardware. There is a broad range of 
                        motherboards, each of which is intended to be c
                        ompatible with a specific model and size of the computer.
